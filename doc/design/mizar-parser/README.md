# mizar-parser Design

Canonical language: English. Japanese companion: [ja/README.md](./ja/README.md).

This directory contains implementation-facing design notes for the `mizar-parser` crate.

`mizar-parser` consumes the frontend-adapted parser token transfer object, applies the Mizar Evo grammar, and produces `mizar-syntax::SurfaceAst`. It owns grammar logic and syntax recovery, but it must not perform semantic name resolution, type inference, overload selection, cluster registration, elaboration, or proof-obligation generation.

Status: parser hardening has grown through task 44. The source/spec
correspondence audit, reserved-word coverage guard, and bilingual documentation
synchronization audit are recorded in the English canonical audit notes. Public
enum policy task 45 remains planned, and task 46 is deferred for future
concrete operator declarations.

## Expected Module Specs And Audits

- [en/grammar.md](./en/grammar.md) - parser entry points and module/item grammar
- [en/pratt.md](./en/pratt.md) - term and formula precedence parsing
- [en/recovery.md](./en/recovery.md) - synchronization, error nodes, and skipped-token handling
- [en/source_spec_audit.md](./en/source_spec_audit.md) - task 43 source/spec and reserved-word coverage audit
- [en/bilingual_documentation_synchronization.md](./en/bilingual_documentation_synchronization.md) - task 44 bilingual documentation synchronization audit
