# mizar-parser: Grammar

Status: minimal task-11 parser entry implemented, task-1 module split in
place, and task-2 private cursor/event infrastructure wired into the internal
`grammar` module; full module/item grammar planned.

## Purpose

This module defines parser entry points and the module/item grammar for Mizar Evo.

## Responsibilities

- consume parser-facing token transfer objects and produce `mizar-syntax::SurfaceAst`;
- parse modules, imports, definitions, registrations, statements, proofs, algorithms, annotations, terms, and formulas;
- keep parsing semantic-free: no name resolution, type inference, overload selection, or proof-obligation generation.

Current behavior:

- the crate-root public API (`parse`, `ParseRequest`, `ParserToken`,
  `ParseOutput`, and related transfer enums/entries) remains reachable at the
  original `mizar_parser::...` paths;
- `grammar` owns the current parser orchestration and syntax-event sink handoff,
  while Pratt expression parsing and recovery policy live in sibling
  implementation modules until later tasks grow the full grammar;
- grammar code emits tokens, ordinary nodes, and recovery nodes through the
  private syntax-event sink and documented `mizar-syntax` builder/accessor API,
  not by depending on rowan storage layout or dense arena indices.

## Task 4: Shared Paths

Production inventory:

```ebnf
module_path       ::= [ relative_prefix ] module_identifier
                      { "." module_identifier } ;
relative_prefix   ::= "." | ".." ;
module_identifier ::= identifier ;

namespace_path    ::= identifier { "." identifier } ;

qualified_symbol  ::= { namespace_segment "." } user_symbol ;
namespace_segment ::= identifier ;
```

`module_path` is the import/export path shape from Chapter 12. It is the only
shared path helper that accepts `relative_prefix`; `namespace_path` is reserved
for citation/reference prefixes and must not accept relative import prefixes.
`qualified_symbol` ends in a parser-facing `user_symbol` token supplied by the
active lexicon, with any preceding namespace segments represented as identifier
segments.

Parser task 4 provides shared helper methods and unit coverage only. It does
not introduce a standalone corpus position because these path forms become
frontend-reachable through later consuming grammar tasks: import items (task 6),
type heads (task 8), terms/formulas, and citations (task 17). The helper emits
`mizar-syntax` task-S-009 path nodes through the syntax-event sink and preserves
dot separators syntactically. It performs no module resolution, namespace
shadowing, symbol identity assignment, citation lookup, or validity checking.

## Public Enum Compatibility

`ParserTokenKind` is `#[non_exhaustive]` for downstream crates. The parser token
transfer vocabulary can grow as parser-facing lexing contexts gain additional
token classes, and downstream consumers should keep wildcard fallback arms.
Matches inside `mizar-parser` remain exhaustive so newly added token kinds force
local parser updates.
