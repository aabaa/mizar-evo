# Module: harness

> Canonical language: English. Japanese companion: [../ja/harness.md](../ja/harness.md).

## Purpose

This module defines the test harness that discovers cases, runs compiler profiles, checks expectations, and reports deterministic results.

## Public API

```rust
pub struct DiscoveryConfig {
    pub workspace_root: PathBuf,
    pub tests_root: PathBuf,
    pub manifest_path: PathBuf,
    pub profile: TestProfile,
    pub validation_mode: ValidationMode,
}

pub struct TestPlan {
    pub cases: Vec<TestCase>,
    pub manifest: TraceManifest,
    pub diagnostics: Vec<ValidationDiagnostic>,
}

pub struct TestCase {
    pub id: TestCaseId,
    pub source_path: PathBuf,
    pub expectation_path: PathBuf,
    pub expectation: Expectation,
}

pub enum TestProfile {
    Fast,
    Full,
    Stress,
    FuzzRegression,
    SnapshotUpdate,
}

pub enum ValidationMode {
    Metadata,
    Development,
    Release,
}

pub struct ParseOnlyRunReport {
    pub results: Vec<ParseOnlyCaseResult>,
    pub diagnostics: Vec<ValidationDiagnostic>,
}

pub struct DeclarationSymbolRunReport {
    pub results: Vec<DeclarationSymbolCaseResult>,
    pub diagnostics: Vec<ValidationDiagnostic>,
}

pub struct TypeElaborationRunReport {
    pub results: Vec<TypeElaborationCaseResult>,
    pub diagnostics: Vec<ValidationDiagnostic>,
}
```

The generic `TestOutcome`/snapshot-reporting surface is future API. Current
active runners expose stage-specific report records while sharing the metadata
plan and validation diagnostics shown above.

## Runner Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| metadata plan | discover sidecars and validate layout, expectation schema, and traceability without executing payloads |
| parse-only | run active `.miz` parse-only cases through `mizar-frontend` and `MizarParserSeam` |
| declaration-symbol | run active `.miz` declaration-symbol cases through frontend parsing and resolver declaration/symbol collection |
| type-elaboration | run active `.miz` type-elaboration cases through frontend parsing and resolver declaration/symbol collection, then surface the missing checker payload-extraction bridge as a stable external dependency gap |
| pass/fail | run `.miz` cases and match expected outcome |
| snapshot | compare canonical snapshot hashes |
| determinism | repeat runs and compare artifacts, diagnostics, and hashes |
| parallel-equivalence | compare sequential and parallel outputs |
| fuzz-regression | run minimized fuzz cases as ordinary committed tests |
| update | rewrite snapshots only when explicitly requested |

## Algorithm / Logic

1. Discover tests through `layout`.
2. Parse and validate every discovered sidecar, then build a canonical
   `TestPlan` whose returned `cases` are filtered by `DiscoveryConfig.profile`.
   Missing `profiles` defaults to `["fast"]`; `Full` includes every valid
   parsed case. Duplicate ids, traceability links, and diagnostics are checked
   across all parsed sidecars, not only the filtered cases.
3. For `parse-only`, select only cases with `stage = "parse_only"`,
   `expected_phase = "parse"`, `.miz` payloads, pass/fail outcomes, and
   `tags = ["active_parse_only"]`. Untagged parse-only sidecars remain
   discovery and traceability metadata.
4. For `declaration-symbol`, select only cases with
   `stage = "declaration_symbol"`, `expected_phase = "resolve"`, `.miz`
   payloads, pass/fail outcomes, and `tags = ["active_declaration_symbol"]`.
   Untagged declaration-symbol sidecars remain discovery and traceability
   metadata.
5. For `type-elaboration`, select only cases with
   `stage = "type_elaboration"`, `expected_phase = "type_check"`, `.miz`
   payloads, pass/fail outcomes, and `tags = ["active_type_elaboration"]`.
   Untagged type-elaboration sidecars remain discovery and traceability
   metadata.
6. Run cases in deterministic display order, even when execution is parallel.
7. Capture compiler outputs as structured records.
8. Match pass/fail expectations before snapshot expectations.
9. Compare general `[[snapshots]]` entries by canonical hash; the current
   parse-only `SurfaceAst` shortcut compares committed text baselines
   byte-for-byte as described below.
10. Report failures with phase, failure category, rejection reason, diagnostic code, and snapshot diff summary.

The current parse-only runner copies each active corpus file into a temporary
`src/` package, runs the real frontend parser seam, requires pass cases to
produce an AST with no assertion diagnostics, and compares fail cases against
the expected bare syntax diagnostic keys. For this syntax-only mode, the runner
uses a harness provider that resolves every frontend import stub to a
`ResolvedImportEntry` with matching `stub_ordinal` and `stub_span`, plus one
`ModuleLexicalSummary` per distinct module id. Summaries contain no exported
symbols except for the narrow `parser.type_fixtures` fixture module, which
injects parser-owned attribute, mode, structure, predicate, and functor shapes
needed by type-expression and operator syntax fixtures. No other import summary
exports symbols; the summaries exist only to keep import syntax cases from
depending on semantic module availability. If parser syntax diagnostics and non-syntax
frontend recovery diagnostics both appear, the runner reports all diagnostic
codes unless the sidecar explicitly includes
`allow_frontend_recovery_diagnostics`. Active parse-only pass/fail sidecars may
also set the transitional `snapshots = "snapshots/parser/<id>.surface_ast.snap"`
field. For those cases, after diagnostics match, the runner requires a
`SurfaceAst` and compares `SurfaceAst::snapshot_text()` with the committed
baseline under `tests/snapshots/`. Snapshot baselines are never rewritten during
normal parse-only runs.

An expectation tagged `active_parse_only` but missing one of the runnable case
predicates is a harness error rather than a silent skip.

The current declaration-symbol runner copies each active `.miz` corpus file
into the same temporary package shape, runs the real frontend, then feeds the
resulting `SurfaceAst` through the resolver declaration-shell collector,
parser-backed signature projection extractor, and symbol collector. Pass cases
require no frontend assertion diagnostics and no resolver symbol diagnostics.
Fail cases compare the resolver's crate-local internal detail keys against
`diagnostic_payloads` when present, or `stable_detail_key` otherwise. The runner
does not require or invent public resolver diagnostic codes while the
diagnostic-code ownership gap remains open; active declaration-symbol
expectations with non-empty `diagnostic_codes` are harness errors.

An expectation tagged `active_declaration_symbol` but missing one of the
runnable case predicates is a harness error rather than a silent skip.

The current type-elaboration runner copies each active `.miz` corpus file into
the same temporary package shape, runs the real frontend, then feeds the
resulting `SurfaceAst` through the resolver declaration-shell collector,
parser-backed signature projection extractor, and symbol collector. This keeps
type-elaboration cases honest about lower-stage prerequisites before checker
payload extraction begins. Task 12 intentionally does not fabricate the missing
source-to-checker bridge: the repository still lacks an AST-wide extraction API
that turns parsed/resolved `.miz` declarations, type expressions, terms,
formulas, coercion sites, and type facts into the checker-owned payloads exposed
by `mizar-checker` tasks 7-11. When parsing and symbol collection succeed, the
runner therefore reports the stable detail key
`type_elaboration.external_dependency.ast_payload_extraction` until that bridge
exists. Active fail cases may assert that key through `diagnostic_payloads` or
`stable_detail_key`; active pass cases that require real checker semantics
remain deferred rather than passing through a stub.

Active type-elaboration expectations with non-empty `diagnostic_codes` are
harness errors until public checker diagnostic codes are specified. An
expectation tagged `active_type_elaboration` but missing one of the runnable
case predicates is a harness error rather than a silent skip.

## Determinism Requirements

The harness checks that identical inputs produce:

- identical artifact hashes;
- identical snapshot hashes;
- identical diagnostic order;
- identical failure records;
- identical proof status;
- identical dependency slices.

Parallel execution may change runtime, not observable results.

## Reporting

Reports must separate:

- unexpected success;
- unexpected failure;
- wrong failure category;
- wrong rejection reason;
- diagnostic order mismatch;
- snapshot mismatch;
- nondeterminism across repeated runs;
- harness infrastructure error.

## Tests

Key scenarios:

- fail test unexpectedly passes;
- pass test emits an error diagnostic;
- snapshot hash differs;
- repeated run produces a different diagnostic order;
- parallel run produces the same artifacts as sequential run.

## Constraints and Assumptions

- Test execution order is not semantic ordering.
- The harness treats cache hits as compiler behavior to verify, not as proof authority.
- Snapshot update mode is opt-in and must be visible in command output.
